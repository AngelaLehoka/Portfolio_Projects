-- WELCOME TO MY ONLINE RETAIL STORE PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS PROJECT!


--The goal is to use linear regression to predict the future trends using 2010 data.
--Cleaning is done in SQL and analysis in Excel.


SELECT *
FROM [Online Retail Project]..OnlineRetail

SELECT InvoiceDate, Quantity, Price
FROM [Online Retail Project]..OnlineRetail

-- Cleaning the InvoiceDate column to be more user friendly

SELECT InvoiceDate
FROM [Online Retail Project]..OnlineRetail


SELECT CONVERT(varchar(10),[InvoiceDate],106) AS [ConvertedDate], Quantity, Price 
FROM [Online Retail Project]..OnlineRetail
WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2010%' AND Quantity is not null AND Price is not null


-- Result is table showing ConvertedDate, Quantity, and Price.
-- Move to excel and analyze the data.
-- Have a look at my complete portfolio to see the results of this project.
